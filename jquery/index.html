                    <h1>Pregnancy Signs</h1>
                    <strong>Are you pregnant, or trying to conceive a baby? Are you wondering whether you could
                        be expecting, but are not sure? The signs and symptoms of pregnancy are many and
                        varied. Some symptoms are almost universal. Other symptoms are tricky, because they
                        can indicate either a pregnancy, a period, or a medical condition. No matter what
                        pregnancy symptoms you are experiencing, you’ll find them on this list. We’ll try
                        our best to help you figure out what is going on with your body. And, as your pregnancy
                        progresses, we will continue to be here for you whenever you are wondering if the
                        sensations you are going through are normal or not. We’ve grouped pregnancy signs
                        into the three trimesters, but please note that some symptoms can occur in any trimester.
                        If you can’t find your symptom in your current trimester of pregnancy, feel free
                        to take a look at the others, too.</strong>

                    <h1>First trimester</h1>
                    <strong>The first trimester of pregnancy is, for many women, the period during which they
                        experience the largest number of unpleasant symptoms. Fatigue and morning sickness
                        are common during this time, but they are by no means the only indications of pregnancy.
                        As your body is working hard to create a stable environment for your rapidly developing
                        embryo, you are likely to encounter any, or all of the following pregnancy signs.</strong>

                    <h1>A positive pregnancy test</h1>
                    <strong>After a missed or late period, most women who were trying to conceive (and even
                        those who were not!) are quickly prompted to take an at-home pregnancy test to see
                        whether they are in fact expecting a baby. A positive pregnancy test is not exactly
                        one of the pregnancy signs, but it is certainly a very powerful indication that you
                        are pregnant. Perhaps it is the most reliable “sign” of pregnancy. How do pregnancy
                        tests work, and is there any chance they could be wrong? DIY pregnancy tests require
                        you to pee onto a stick, as most of you are aware of. What does a pregnancy test
                        need your urine for? Well, they work by detecting the hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin,
                        which is produced as soon as a fertilized egg starts implanting itself into the lining
                        of your uterine wall. This hormone, often just called hCG, dominates the female body
                        in those early weeks and can be found in the blood and in the urine. Blood tests
                        for pregnancy are even more accurate than urine tests, and they can be done earlier
                        on – before you have even missed your period. So, how soon after a missed period
                        can you take a pregnancy test? Immediately! At-home pregnancy tests are extremely
                        reliable once a woman has missed her period. The highest concentration of hCG is
                        found in a woman’s urine first thing in the morning. That is why the general recommendation
                        used to be that a pregnancy test should be done at that time. But technology has
                        moved on a bit, and modern pregnancy tests can be used at any time of day. If you
                        test too early, it is possible to get a negative pregnancy test and to still be pregnant.
                        If you are on medication containing hCG, false positives are also possible. Generally
                        speaking, pregnancy tests are very reliable. If you have just tested and your test
                        showed that you were pregnant, it’s not too early for us to say, Congratulations!</strong>

                    <h1>A bloated or tender abdomen</h1>
                    <strong>Are you newly pregnant, and have you noticed that your abdomen is slightly bloated
                        or tender? Some women find themselves wondering if it is possible that they are already
                        “showing” that early on in pregnancy. The truth is that a bloated abdomen is in no
                        way caused by the size of your baby, but mostly by hormonal changes in your body.
                        Abdominal tenderness and cramping are common because your uterus, a large and strong
                        muscle, is going through a lot of changes. These sensations can be compared to muscle
                        tenderness after you have just started a new work-out regime; your uterus is getting
                        used to being active, where it was previously sedentary. If you have just found out
                        that you are pregnant, and yet you are already thinking about buying maternity clothes,
                        you are not alone. Almost all women will notice some abdominal bloating during their
                        first trimester. Along with morning sickness, changes in your breasts, and fatigue,
                        a bloated abdomen is one of the most frequent pregnancy signs after a missed period
                        and a positive pregnancy test. What caused bloating during early pregnancy? Progesterone
                        is a hormone that is essential to pregnancy. It is responsible for many of the feelings
                        you will have during the first trimester of your pregnancy, and a bloated abdomen
                        is one of them. Believe it or not, the bloating itself is more likely to be situated
                        inside your bowels and your stomach than your uterus. Progesterone relaxes muscle
                        tissue throughout your body, and along with bloating, excessive wind or (to put it
                        in plain English) farting is also common in the early stages of pregnancy. To get
                        relief from bloating, try drinking plenty of fluids like water or herbal teas. Avoiding
                        highly processed foods and eating healthy but small meals can also help.</strong>

                    <h1>Sore and tender breasts</h1>
                    <strong>Sore and tender breasts are a common occurrence when a woman is about to get her
                        period. Just before the onset of menstruation, the female body experiences a surge
                        in the hormones estrogen, progesterone and prolactin. This cocktail is responsible
                        for breasts that feel heavier, are a bit painful to the touch, and are slightly bigger
                        than usual. Sore and tender breasts are also a very common early pregnancy symptom.
                        But because this probably happens to you every month, it can be difficult to recognize
                        it as a sign of pregnancy. The cause of breast changes in early pregnancy is exactly
                        the same as the cause of breast changes during your monthly cycle – hormones. It
                        is easy to assume that your tender breasts are a signal that your menstruation is
                        about to start. Unfortunately, there is no formula to distinguish tender breasts
                        before a period from tender breasts that are caused by early pregnancy. The only
                        difference when you are pregnant is that your breasts will continue to feel sore,
                        bigger, and more tender, and your period will not turn up. Breast changes are often
                        one of the earliest symptoms of pregnancy. Most women will notice a change in their
                        breasts before their period was due, and will notice that their breasts will continue
                        to go through changes during their whole pregnancies. As your due date draws nearer,
                        and your body prepares itself for childbirth and breastfeeding, you are likely to
                        start leaking colostrum, the first milk your baby gets, from your breasts. Colostrum
                        production can start as early as 22 weeks gestation. Many women will see that their
                        breasts increase in size as their pregnancy goes on. The size and color of your nipples
                        may also change. Do not be alarmed by this – it is totally normal. Breasts may also
                        feel slightly lumpy during pregnancy and while breastfeeding, but tender breasts
                        alone are not enough to make you conclude you are pregnant. If you are looking for
